//! # Half-Edge Graph Representation
//!
//! This module provides the core data structures and algorithms for representing
//! and manipulating graphs using the **half-edge** (or doubly connected edge list - DCEL)
//! data structure. This representation is particularly useful for algorithms that
//! require efficient traversal of graph topology, such as iterating around faces,
//! finding incident edges to a node, or quickly accessing an edge's opposite pair.
//!
//! ## Key Concepts and Components:
//!
//! ### 1. `HedgeGraph<E, V, S>`
//! This is the central struct representing a graph.
//!   - `E`: Generic type for data associated with edges.
//!   - `V`: Generic type for data associated with nodes (vertices).
//!   - `S`: A type implementing `NodeStorage`, which defines how node data and
//!          their connectivity to half-edges are stored.
//!
//! `HedgeGraph` stores half-edges in an `edge_store` (typically `SmartHedgeVec`)
//! and nodes in a `node_store`.
//!
//! ### 2. `Hedge` and `NodeIndex`
//!   - `Hedge`: An identifier (often an index) for a single directed half-edge.
//!     Each undirected edge in the graph is typically represented by two oppositely
//!     directed half-edges.
//!   - `NodeIndex`: A simple wrapper around `usize` used to identify nodes in the graph.
//!
//! ### 3. Involutions (`involution` module)
//! A crucial concept in this implementation is the **involution** on half-edges.
//! An involution is a function that, when applied twice, returns the original input.
//! In the context of a half-edge graph, the primary involution is finding the
//! **opposite half-edge**.
//!   - `Involution`: The struct managing this mapping.
//!   - `HedgePair`: Represents how hedges are paired (e.g., forming a full edge,
//!     being unpaired/dangling, or split).
//!   - `Flow`: Indicates the underlying directionality of a half-edge (Source or Sink)
//!     relative to its edge.
//!   - `Orientation`: Indicates the superficial orientation of an edge (Default, Reversed,
//!     Undirected).
//!
//! The `inv(hedge: Hedge) -> Hedge` method on `HedgeGraph` is the primary way to
//! access the opposite half-edge.
//!
//! ### 4. Node Storage (`nodestore` module)
//! This module defines how nodes are stored and how they relate to the half-edges
//! that originate from them.
//!   - `NodeStorage` trait: An abstraction for different node storage strategies.
//!   - `NodeStorageOps` trait: Provides operations on node storage.
//!   - Each node typically stores a collection of its outgoing (or incident) half-edges.
//!
//! ### 5. Subgraphs (`subgraph` module)
//! This module provides extensive support for defining, manipulating, and querying
//! subgraphs. A subgraph is essentially a subset of the half-edges of a parent graph.
//!   - `SubGraph` trait: Defines the basic interface for a subgraph.
//!   - `SubGraphOps` trait: Provides operations applicable to subgraphs.
//!   - Various concrete subgraph types exist, such as:
//!     - `InternalSubGraph`: Represents a subgraph composed of edges internal to a region.
//!     - `HedgeNode`: Represents a "node" in a higher-level graph structure, possibly
//!       formed by contracting a subgraph. It contains an `internal_graph` and `hairs`
//!       (external connections).
//!     - `Cycle`: Represents a cycle in the graph.
//!     - `OrientedCut`: Represents a cut separating the graph.
//!
//! Operations include creating subgraphs from filters, extracting subgraphs,
//! performing boolean operations (union, intersection, difference), and analyzing
//! subgraph properties.
//!
//! ### 6. Graph Operations
//! The `HedgeGraph` provides a rich API for:
//!   - **Construction**: Building graphs using `HedgeGraphBuilder`, adding nodes and edges
//!     (`add_dangling_edge`, `add_pair`).
//!   - **Modification**: Deleting hedges (`delete_hedges`), splitting edges (`split_edge`),
//!     joining graphs (`join`), sewing dangling edges (`sew`), and identifying/contracting
//!     nodes (`identify_nodes`).
//!   - **Traversal & Access**: Getting an edge's opposite (`inv`), finding the node a
//!     hedge points to (`node_id`), iterating over neighbors (`iter_crown`), and
//!     accessing edge/node data.
//!   - **Analysis**: Checking connectivity (`is_connected`), counting components
//!     (`count_connected_components`), finding cycle bases (`cycle_basis`), spanning trees
//!     (`all_spanning_trees`), and calculating cyclotomatic numbers.
//!   - **Serialization/Visualization**: Generating DOT format strings for graph visualization.
//!
//! This module forms the backbone of the `linnet` library, enabling complex graph
//! manipulations with a focus on subgraphs and topological features.
